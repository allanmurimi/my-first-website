        <h3> Who is Allan Murimi?</h3>
        <p>Born & Raised in the highlands of Central region of Kenya and studied most of my education in the
            same region. I have grown up to become an enthusiastic, agressive, self-motivated, reliable,
            responsible and hard working man.
            I am a mature team worker and adaptable to all challenging situations.
            I am able to work well both in a team environment as well as using own initiative.</p>

        <h3> Why I Want To Learn Coding</h3>

        <ol>
            <h4>Passion</h4>
        </ol>
        <p>You have the idea, but now you need to depend on someone to build it for you.
            Knowing how to code, you can take matters in your hand and start bootstrapping one the same day.
            Save the trouble and build a working prototype yourself. </p>

        <ol>
            <h4>Mind Engaging</h4>
        </ol>

        <p></p>The programming world is a fast-paced environment.
        It’s impossible to know everything, but it’s possible to specialize in a specific programming
        language or specific tooling and become really good at one particular programming stack.
        programming definitely keeps you busy as there’s a never-ending river of information to absorb.

        <ol>
            <h4>Fun Hobby</h4>
        </ol>

        <p>Not everyone has to work in a professional environment. Coding is much more than a corporate 8-5 job.
            Coding can be a fun hobby for anyone, there are no entry barriers. Anyone who has an internet connection
            and a computer can start coding as of this moment. Coding adheres to no limitations.</p>
